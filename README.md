## Welcome to my GitHub Home! üëØ
<br>
For a quick assessment of my work I briefly summarised 4 of my (many) projects on GitHub: <br>
**1. Heart Risk Prediction App** <br>
**2. LEGO Parts and Shades** <br>
**3. Two-Container Deployment of Stock Price Prediction** <br>
**4. Shopping and Other Addictions during Covid-19** <br>

<br> 

### 1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction App
This project was inspired by the **Heart Attack Risk Analysis** competition on **Kaggle**. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 lifestyle and biometric features. After submitting my prediction to the Kaggle competition, I decided to develop another model, prioritizing precision to allow for more sensitive detection of high-risk cases. This model employs the **XGBoost** algorithm with **probability estimation**. If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct 43% of the time. After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on **Google Cloud Platform** with a Streamlit frontend. The scripts (written in **Python**) can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle).

### 2. LEGO Parts and Shades
Do you like LEGO? Then you'll love this little **[visualization project](https://github.com/anikomaraz/LEGO/blob/main/lego.ipynb)** that analyzes LEGO parts, sets, and color shades since their inception in 1949! My favorite image:

### 3. Two-Container Deployment of Stock Price Prediction
This project was part of my Data Science Bootcamp demo, where I handled the **data engineering** aspect. This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers) contains the full deployment: **two backend containers‚Äî**(1) the **Python** container fetching data via API calls and containing the model weights, and (2) the **R** container creating visualizations using **ggplot**. The frontend is displayed using Streamlit. To learn more about how I deployed this project using two containers (Python and R) and linked it to the Streamlit frontend, check out my [blog post](https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers/blob/master/blogpost/dockerize.md). A visual summary of what happens under the hood:

### 4. Shopping and Other Addictions during Covid-19
This project provided a unique opportunity to observe how the progress of the pandemic and the associated distress influenced addictive behaviors in the first 6 months in the USA. Using MTurk, we sampled 25 Americans every 3 days and administered our survey via formr (an R framework) to observe changes in patterns. **Live data quality checks**, reminders and feedback was included. You can find all the information in the [repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/covid19-shopping) and in the **two academic papers**: [Paper 1](https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2006/10/4/article-p912.xml?body=pdf-23898) on excessive behaviors and [Paper 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9109632/pdf/jba-11-088.pdf) focusing specifically on **shopping**.
