## Welcome to my GitHub Home! ðŸ‘¯
Here you will find a brief summary of my projects that you can access on GitHub. 

### 1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction App
This project was inspired by the Heart Attack Risk Analysis competition on Kaggle, with predictions submitted to an ongoing challenge. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 features of lifestyle and biometrics. After submitting my prediction to the Kaggle competition, I decided to develop another model, prioritising precision as a measure of goodness of fit to allow for more sensitive detection of high-risk cases.This model employs the XGBoost model with probability estimation. If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct 43% of the time. After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on Google Cloud Platform with a Streamlit frontend. The scripts (written in Python) can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle).

### 2. LEGO Parts and Shades
Do you like LEGO? Then you will love this [visualisation project](https://github.com/anikomaraz/LEGO/blob/main/lego.ipynb) that analyses LEGO parts, sets, and shades of color since their beginning in 1949! My favourite image:

### 3. Two-Container Deployment of Stock Price Prediction
This project was done as part of my Data Science Bootcamp demo project, where I was entrusted with the data engineering part. This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers) contains the full deployment: two backend containers: (1) the Python container fetching data via API calls and contains the model weights + (2) the R container creating a beautiful visualisation in ggplot. The frontend is then displayed using Streamlit. To learn more about how I deployed this project using two containers (Python and R) and linking it to the Streamlit frontend, go to my [blogpost](https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers/blob/master/blogpost/dockerize.md). A visual summary of what happens under the hood:

### 4. Shopping and Other Addictions during Covid-19
This was a unique opportunity to observe how the progress of the pandemic and the distress influenced addictive behaviours in the first 6 months in the USA. Via MTurk we sampled 25 Americans every 3 days (never the same person) and administered our survey via formr (an R framework) to observe changes in the pattern. You can find all information in the [repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/covid19-shopping) and in the 2 academic papers: [Paper 1](https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2006/10/4/article-p912.xml?body=pdf-23898) on excessive behaviours and [Paper 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9109632/pdf/jba-11-088.pdf) focusing specifically on shopping.
