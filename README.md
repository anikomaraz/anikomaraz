## Welcome to my GitHub Home! 👯
Here you will find a brief summary of my projects that you can access on GitHub.

### 1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction App

  <p>This project was inspired by the Heart Attack Risk Analysis competition on Kaggle. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 lifestyle and biometric features. After submitting my prediction to the Kaggle competition, I decided to develop another model, prioritizing precision to allow for more sensitive detection of high-risk cases. This model employs the XGBoost algorithm with probability estimation. If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct 43% of the time. After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on Google Cloud Platform with a Streamlit frontend. The scripts (written in Python) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle">this repository</a>.</p>

  <p>Do you like LEGO? Then you'll love this <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/LEGO/blob/main/lego.ipynb">visualization project</a> that analyzes LEGO parts, sets, and color shades since their inception in 1949! My favorite image:</p>

### 3. Two-Container Deployment of Stock Price Prediction

  <p>This project was part of my Data Science Bootcamp demo, where I handled the data engineering aspect. This <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers">GitHub repository</a> contains the full deployment: two backend containers—(1) the Python container fetching data via API calls and containing the model weights, and (2) the R container creating visualizations using ggplot. The frontend is displayed using Streamlit. To learn more about how I deployed this project using two containers (Python and R) and linked it to the Streamlit frontend, check out my <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers/blob/master/blogpost/dockerize.md">blog post</a>.

### 4. Shopping and Other Addictions during Covid-19

  <p>This project provided a unique opportunity to observe how the progress of the pandemic and the associated distress influenced addictive behaviors in the first 6 months in the USA. Using MTurk, we sampled 25 Americans every 3 days (never the same person) and administered our survey via formr (an R framework) to observe changes in patterns. You can find all the information in the <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/covid19-shopping">repository</a> and in the two academic papers: <a href="https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2006/10/4/article-p912.xml?body=pdf-23898">Paper 1</a> on excessive behaviors and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9109632/pdf/jba-11-088.pdf">Paper 2</a> focusing specifically on shopping.</p>
