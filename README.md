### Predict Drug Use in Germany
I've recently had the honour to have access to wastewater analysis results and dates regarding different compounds (drugs, such as MDMA, amphetamine, cocaine, etc.) collected over 150 cities in Europe. Data include measures from the past 10 years for one week each year among which are 16 German cities - that's a lot of exciting data! So I decided to work on a model to predict drug use based on publicly available data (i.e. tweets, wikipedia and google searches). *The goal is to display our live (automated) predictions on a public website to help the work of harm reduction and drug monitoring teams especially in the party scena.* I am looking for collaborators to share the workload with.  

Contact me if you: 
- find pleasure in web scraping to gather data by date from Twitter, Wikipedia and Google :earth_americas:
- can't wait to add <s>dark</s> magic to data by training a deep learning model on textual and nontextual data (with a time component included)  :milky_way:
- enjoy creating simple but powerful visualisations from complex datastructure :city_sunrise:
- excited to deploy and automate our model :rocket:

I can't wait to hear from you! :blush:   aniko.maraz[at]gmail[dot]com
