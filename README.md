## Welcome to my GitHub Home! üëØ
<br>

For a quick assessment of my work I briefly summarised 4 of my faviourite projects on GitHub: open the section to see the details.
<br> <br>

<details>
<summary> <b>1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction App: </b> An ML model trained on (fake) Kaggle data, fully deployed, receiving user input (written in Python).</summary>
<br> 
This project was inspired by the <b>Heart Attack Risk Analysis</b> competition on <b>Kaggle</b>. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 lifestyle and biometric features. After submitting my prediction to the Kaggle competition, I decided to develop another model, prioritizing precision to allow for more sensitive detection of high-risk cases. This model employs the <b>XGBoost</b> algorithm with <b>probability estimation</b>. If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct 43% of the time. After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on <b>Google Cloud Platform</b> with a Streamlit frontend. The scripts (written in <b>Python</b>) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle">this repository</a>.

<summary> <b> 2. LEGO Parts and Shades: </b> Visualisations of real LEGO data. </summary>
  <br>
Do you like LEGO? Then you'll love this little <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/LEGO/blob/main/lego.ipynb"><b>visualization project</b></a> that analyzes LEGO parts, sets, and color shades since their inception in 1949. My favorite image:

<summary> <b> 3. Two-Container (R and Python) Deployment of Stock Price Prediction: </b> Bootcamp project deployment with live data fetching.</summary>
<br>
This project was part of my Data Science Bootcamp demo, where I handled the <b>data engineering</b> aspect. This <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers"><b>GitHub repository</b></a> contains the full deployment: <b>two backend containers‚Äî</b>(1) the <b>Python</b> container fetching data via API calls and containing the model weights, and (2) the <b>R</b> container creating visualizations using <b>ggplot</b>. The frontend is displayed using Streamlit. To learn more about how I deployed this project using two containers (Python and R) and linked it to the Streamlit frontend, check out my <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/stock_prediction_2containers/blob/master/blogpost/dockerize.md"><b>blog post</b></a>. A visual summary of what happens under the hood:

<summary> <b> 4. Shopping and Other Addictions during Covid-19: </b> Academic project (real data) survey framework, statistical data analysis, visualisation and publication based on R code.</summary>
<br>
This project provided a unique opportunity to observe how the progress of the pandemic and the associated distress influenced addictive behaviors in the first 6 months in the USA. Using MTurk, we sampled 25 Americans every 3 days and administered our survey via formr (an R framework) to observe changes in patterns. <b>Live data quality checks</b>, reminders and feedback was included. You can find all the information in the <a href="https://github.com/anikomaraz/covid19-shopping"><b>repository</b></a> and in the two academic papers: <a href="https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2006/10/4/article-p912.xml?body=pdf-23898"><b>Paper 1</b></a> on excessive behaviors and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9109632/pdf/jba-11-088.pdf"><b>Paper 2</b></a> focusing specifically on <b>shopping</b>.
