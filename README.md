## Welcome to my GitHub Home! ðŸ‘¯
Here you will find a brief summary of my projects that you can access on GitHub. 

### 1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction App
This project was inspired by the Heart Attack Risk Analysis competition on Kaggle, with predictions submitted to an ongoing challenge. The task was to predict heart attack risk (low/high) given 25 features of lifestyle and biometrics. After submitting my prediction to the Kaggle competition, I decided to develop another model, prioritising precision as a measure of goodness of fit to allow for more sensitive detection of high-risk cases.This model employs the XGBoost model with probability estimation. If the model identifies a positive case, it is correct 43% of the time. After several iterations, the project culminated in deployment on Google Cloud Platform with a Streamlit frontend. The scripts (written in Python) can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/anikomaraz/heart_attack_kaggle).

Contact me if you: 
- find pleasure in web scraping to gather data by date from Twitter, Wikipedia and Google :earth_americas:
- can't wait to add <s>dark</s> magic to data by training a deep learning model on textual and nontextual data (with a time component included)  :milky_way:
- enjoy creating simple but powerful visualisations from complex datastructure :city_sunrise:
- excited to deploy and automate our model :rocket:
